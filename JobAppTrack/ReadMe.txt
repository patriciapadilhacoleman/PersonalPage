Job Application Tracker

The goal of this simple Web app is to help a job seeker keep track of where he/she has applied and follow up easier. In this first phase, I have implemented a simple user-interface utilizing bootstrap. I spend most of my time designing the flow of the UX and fine-tuning the concepts we learned in the HTML5 and CSS chapters.
I started then to add the JavaScript and JQuery concepts, but have fallen short on time.
A later version will add a visual representation of the new applications and new Interviews and implement some PHP and a SQL database.

Thank you for the overview of the Web Application Development.
